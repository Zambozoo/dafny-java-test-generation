  Dafny is a modeling and specification language with a static verifier to prove that a program implements its specification. Although it includes a compiler to \texttt{Java}, the resulting programs lack efficiency, readability, and any guarantee of preserving correctness. AWS is working on a specialized compiler so that Dafny can be used as a modeling language for web-services. The work in this proposal is to generate a \texttt{JUnit} test suite from a Dafny model that gives object branch coverage (e.g., includes short-circuit evaluation) and specification coverage (e.g.,, negative and positive tests for post-conditions). Such a test suite provides some assurance that the compiler preserves the static correctness properties of the Dafny source model.
